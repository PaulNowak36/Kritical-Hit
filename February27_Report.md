# Moonshot Project KriticalHit: February 27th report 
 
In December 2022, my Moonshot project named KriticalHit has been validated by the Algosup team, who gave me the greenlight to start working on it.

At the beginning of the year 2003, I’ve started to write weekly reports about my activities on my computer. 
They are document resumes of my accomplishments, problems, observations and goals that I need to achieve. I try to update them each day if I manage to find time working on the development of KriticalHit  
Indeed, I wanted to leave a trace of any kind of work I was doing, in case I have to check older files for my future work. 

In fact, I’m currently in the pre-production phase of KriticalHit, which means I am focusing on the Planning and the Research part of my product.

For now, I’m still trying to figure out how I will organize myself (tools to use, main tasks to accomplish) while doing researches about valuable information about my work. In order to have a good start, I have to make sure about to have the rules about how my product would work, so I will be ablt to work on the functional and technical specifications.

Actually, I’m planning to use a management project software to organize all the data, tasks, documents and progress of my work. I’ve done some research about the best ones, and I’m hesitating between Trello and Wrike. 

Meanwhile, I’ve started researches about game engines in general, like Gamemaker(A 2D game engine), to have an idea of how I could build my software.  
Indeed, François Gutherz from Harfang3D company gave me advices about how they made Harfang3d, so I have several leads about how I could build my game engine. 

Finally, after gathering everything I will need for managing my project, and starting my researches, I will start to study further about how I will build KriticalHit and make a decision.  

Will I build this software from scratch ? Or build it based on an existing one ?
