Moonshot Project February 27th report 
 
At the beginning of the year 2003, I’ve started to write on computers weekly reports about my activities regarding my Moonshot Project called KriticalHit. 
They are a document resume of my accomplishments, problems, observations and goals I need to achieve.  

Indeed, I wanted to leave a trace of any kind of work I was doing, so it could help me for the future. 
Now it has been finally validated by the Algosup Team, I’m currently in both the Planning and the Research phase of the project.  

That means that I’m trying to figure out how I will organize myself (tools to use, first tasks to accomplish) while doing researches about valuable information about my work. 

Actually, I’m planning to use a management project software to organize all the data, tasks, documents and progress of my work. I’ve done some research about the best ones, and I’m hesitating between Trello and Wrike. 

Meanwhile, I’ve started researches about game engines in general, like Gamemaker, to have an idea of how I could build my software.  
Indeed, François Gutherz from Harfang3D company gave me advices about how they made Harfang3d. 

Finally, after gathering everything I will need for managing my project, and starting my researches, I will start to study further about how I will build KriticalHit and make a decision.  

Will I build this software from scratch ? Or build it based on an existing one ?
