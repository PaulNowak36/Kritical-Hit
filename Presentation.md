## Project Name
The name of my Moonshot Project is KriticalHit.

## Context
Making an RPG game (often made in 2D) is a long and difficult process. 
Many features have to be taken into account: the characters, the levels, the game events, but also the strategies of the combat system. 
This is why the game servers/engines are already equipped with configuration tools. 
These "RPG makers", whether they are professional game engines or softwares created by fans, allow video game designers from all over the world to let their creativity flow.  
Nowadays, game engines are experiencing a real growth in trying to satisfy the tastes and preferences of customers. 
In this field, the evolution of technology is also an important factor. 
However, existing RPG creation software has, it seems to me, one drawback: either they have limited resources, either they do not have, in my opinion, a sufficiently intuitive interface for trainee gamemakers. 
One of the main elements to consider when making an RPG is the combat system. 
Indeed, this is an important criterion of satisfaction that a game can give you. 
A recent game, even if it follows a certain tradition in its gameplay, will always try to be original in order to stand out from the rest. 
But for this, the game maker has to think a lot about scripting to design:  
How do the battles work? 
Is it turn-by-turn based like in the Pokemon game?  
Is there a more complex strategy? 
Nowadays, some players would like to be able to expand their possibilities: other than the default ones offered, they would like different RPG game features. 
Installing plugins to modify their fangame is too time consuming for players. 

## Users stories
- Persona 1: As a developer specializing in game engineering, I would like a more powerful tool, adapted to my taste, to help me design a better combat system  
-Persona 2: As a fan, a RPG game creator and a Game Design apprentice, I would like to create my own combat mechanics/features for my fangame. 
-Persona 3: As the CEO of a game company, I would like my firm to publish more diverse RPG games more often. 

## Solution proposed
The solution is a software in the form of a game engine with an interactive and user-friendly interface. 
The goal is for it to benefit both amateur developers and professionals alike. 
But instead of being a classic RPG maker, this one will focus solely on managing the combat system. 
Its goal is to produce custom combat mechanics to be implemented in an upcoming RPG game. 
It will also allow the creator to express his creativity. 

## Functionalities
My software application will have an interface similar to the level editing game "Super Mario Maker". There will be a menu with many more visible icons, and the user will be able to select the tools he needs more quickly. 
-The software’s main feature will permit the user to set up his own battle mechanics. 
Either he will have to choose already existing battle mechanics (Pokemon, Final Fantasy, etc...) which he can adjust slightly, or he will be able to create his own battle mechanics from 0. 
-In the process of making the battle system, the user will have to choose the stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, etc...) and set up how they work. He can also create some new ones. 
- It will also be possible to create your own damage calculator based on the interacting statistics. 
- It will also be possible to define how weaknesses, skills, statuses, buff/nerf abilities work and how they interact with the gameplay. 
-The software will help the Gamemaker to design the “skeleton” of a new battle system, and set up how many properties must be taken into account. 

## Benefits
Having a simple interface to design battle mechanics more efficiently and quickly will allow an increase in productivity and reduce developing time. 

## Programming language
C++, one of the most popular languages for creating game engines. 

## Project time
It will take at least one and a half years to develop my project. 

## Future
I plan to add additional features for the combat mechanics, especially around character movement. 
For example, he can move throughout a grid, just like in the MMORPG game Dofus.
