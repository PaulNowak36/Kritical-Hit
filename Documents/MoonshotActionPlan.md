# Moonshot Action Plan

**Date:** February 5th, 2025

## A - Specific-Term Goals (1 to 2 Weeks)

### Reorganize the ClickUp file and all remaining tasks (1 week)
- Find a person experienced in task management that could help me.
- Find a better strategy to monitor and complete tasks and sub-tasks.
- Reorganize the remaining tasks once again.

### Making the next 2 stacked widgets for Version 1 of my Moonshot (2 weeks)
- Create a global stylesheet for buttons.
- Test gradient effects on buttons.
- Develop stacked widget for creating a new template.
- Develop stacked widget for main template menu.
- Check for a potential logo.
- Look into a potential Qt Creator book.

### Continuing progress on my technical specifications (1 week)
- Decide what to include in the sections for System Architecture, Technologies Used, and Data Management.
- Determine how to organize the files for our software.

## B - Concrete Actions to Take Starting Tomorrow

### Show my Moonshot progress to my father
- Explain my situation, obstacles, and objectives.
- Ask if he is familiar with task management or knows someone who is.
- Demonstrate my ClickUp file and how it works.
- Discuss LinkedIn for visibility.

### Work on V0.1 of my Moonshot
- Test the global stylesheet.
- Add gradient effects for buttons based on their `#ID`.
- Review how I organize my next `StackedWidget`.

### Measure my technical specifications progress in %
- Review completed sections and identify remaining work.
- Check how project folders are organized in my file explorer.

## C - Possible Obstacles and Anticipated Solutions

  - Find another person for guidance.
  - Write down major tasks in a separate file for clarity.

  - Prioritize coding over documentation.
  - Determine what must be completed for Version 1 and reorganize tasks accordingly.
