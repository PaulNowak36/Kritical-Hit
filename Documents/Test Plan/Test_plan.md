- Reference to industry standards for game testing
- Mention of specific testing tools and frameworks to be used
- Clear success criteria for the testing phase -->

Meets defined requirements, test various user scenarios, and anticipate the most common bugs and glitches.
Must assist QA to build a testing strategy + ensure product correctness.

### 1.2 Objectives
<!-- Consider adding:
- Specific version targets (v1.0 for June 24th, 2025)
- Detailed timeline for testing phases
- Clear metrics for measuring testing success
- Reference to the MoSCoW prioritization from functional specs -->

- Explain project goal

- Showcase product main features
- Project date of completion and in which version

## 2. Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Functional Testing
<!-- Consider adding:
- Specific test scenarios for battle mechanics
- Database CRUD operation tests
- UI component validation tests
- Test coverage targets -->

#### Unit Testing
Individual units/parts of the software are tested separately from the rest of the systems. They can focus on a specific function, method, class, or a module. Automated.

#### Integration Testing
Different parts/modules of the app are tested together. Identify issues that are caused when coupling multiple components together, and ensure the system work as a whole.

#### System Testing
Ensure the entire app work as a whole + meets functional and non-functional requirements. Test the app in various scenarios and under various conditions, including normal and abnormal usage, making sure it handle different situations correctly.

#### Acceptance Testing
Check if app meets acceptance criteria and is ready for development. Tested by other users before version release.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Testing
<!-- Consider adding:
- Specific performance benchmarks from functional specs (e.g., UI response under 100ms)
- Load testing for database operations
- Memory usage monitoring during battle simulations
- Screen resolution and scaling tests (150% display scaling) -->

#### Performance Testing
- Assess performance and response time under different workloads
- Test scenarios:
  - Multiple battle templates loaded
  - Rapid UI interactions
  - Continuous battle simulations
  - Database operations under load

#### Usability Testing
- Evaluate User Interface and User Experience
- Focus areas:
  - Menu navigation flow
  - Battle interface clarity
  - Rule configuration accessibility
  - Visual feedback effectiveness

#### Compatibility Testing
- Windows 11 Pro (primary platform)
- macOS compatibility testing
- Display scaling variations
- Different hardware configurations

### 2.3 Regression Testing
<!-- Consider adding:
- Automated test suite configuration
- Critical path testing scenarios
- Version control integration
- Release testing checklist -->

Testing Summary Table:

| Test Batch | Date | Tests Performed | Bugs Found | Tests Completed |
|------------|------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Initial    | TBD  | 0              | 0          | 0              |
| Pre-v1.0   | TBD  | 0              | 0          | 0              |
| Pre-v2.0   | TBD  | 0              | 0          | 0              |
