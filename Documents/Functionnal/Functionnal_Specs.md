# 1. Overview

### 1.1 Document Purpose
This document has been written to provide the functional specification of a Moonshot Project named Kritical Hit. In fact, the Moonshot Project is a final evaluation imposed by the ALGOSUP school to create our own unique and professional project through the whole scolarity and to validate our Master level in Software development.

### 1.2 Context
Video games have always been a huge domain in the entertainment industry, generating nowadays around 180 billions of american dollars. Indeed, the market is still in constant evolution due to the improvement of video game hardwares and softwares, especially thanks to the rise of the game engines. While they are also used in other varieties of industries, they brought an innovative approach to create more sophisticated games due to the complexity of the most modern iterations.

However, the development of a video game has always been a long and minutious task for many software engineers. Due to the development of the new technologies and the evolution of the general audience tastes, video games need to reach a good level of performance and quality to be appealing and marketable.

As an instance, the role-playing represent a unique genre in the video game industry that is greatly loved by players. Though, this genre require several features to be taken into account, notably the battle system that represent the charm of RPGs and draw diverse players. That's why game design softwares are used to build them up.

The problem is that these kinds of software, despite the freedom they provide, either have limited resources or doesn't look appealing enough for new gamemakers. Furthermore, installing plugins to improve these "helpful" tools would be too time consuming for amateurs and game designers.

### 1.3 RPG Domain

An RPG (Role-Play Game) is a game where the player embodies a fictional character that will evolve, often alongside other characters, where he will accomplish diverse quests, fight enemies and explore a more or less imaginary world. Indeed, RPGs are based on a point system and experience level that can be increased and allow the player to get stronger and receive new abilities. 

Inspired by several sources like the Dungeon and Dragons pen-and-paper games and fantasy writings authors like J. R. R. Tolkien, RPGs bring a whole new concept of entertainment with the success of Franchises like Pokemon, Final Fantasy, and Dragon Quest. Throughout time, they differienced themselves in subgenres like Action RPG (including action gameplay) and MMORPG (online role-playing).

Each player chooses a character, whether completely create him or emboding a defined one (like Cloud from Final Fantasy VII), and have the freedom to change its appearance (clothes, weapons, magic powers) and its statistics (strength, agility, vitality...).
