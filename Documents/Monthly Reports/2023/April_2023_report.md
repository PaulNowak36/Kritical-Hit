# Moonshot Project KriticalHit: April 2023 report 

This month, I managed to complete my Features List for my KriticalHit project. Indeed, they contain details about their description, process, degree of importance and requirements.

In the process, Konstantinos Dimopoulos has advised me not to detail the features too much and to think more about the core stuff. Now, I need to validate them and decide which one I will accomplish depending on their importance. 
 
I managed to decide the milestones to accomplish my project:  
 
    - Project Scope decided 
    - UI prototype finished 
    - Software Development started 
    - Quality Assurance Testing 
    - Testing User Acceptance 
    - Project Delivery 

Although I seem to have completed my task list, I have to confirm the time required for each of them as I still have trouble to make these approximations. 

In fact, I believe I should get inquire more about the average required time for my objectives and milestones. 

By the way, Konstantinos Dimopoulos proposed me to use Figma as a prototype designer software. For that, I just need to watch some tutorials about this tool and see what can of UI mock-ups I could use for KriticalHit’s interface. In May, I must start working on the design prototype. 

However, as I want to create a software like a game engine but focusing on the battle system, I have to clearly define the type of software it is (Web Application ? Software Framework ?). If I’m able to know that detail, I could organize my tasks in a better way. 

During my vacations, I bought a C++ reminder book to help me learn about the programming language for my future software.
