# Moonshot Project KriticalHit: March 2023 monthly report. 
 
I pursued my research about different game engines, like construct or Gamemaker, to get an idea on how my software would look like. 
 
Indeed, I’ve spoken to Konstantinos Dimopoulos, my Game Design teacher, about my project. I wanted to ask him advice on how to make my engine as interactive and user-friendly as possible. 
While proposing me some applications, he told me that he will contact me again if he finds any interesting UI mock-ups provider. 

Then, a comrade advised me to use Clickup as a project management tool. So, I created a project for Kritical Hit where I’ve listed all my tasks, sorted them in different domains (Planning, Research, Design, Development, Testing, and Deployment & Maintenance) and importance.

I also created a Gantt diagram to visualize my tasks and tried to plan how much time I require to solve each of them. This view is very likely to change in the next weeks. 

After I created document template for project management (continuous improvement and brainstorming subject), I’ve also started to follow a C++ tutorial course on Youtube by “The Cherno”.  

Finally, as I was still trying to figure out how to build my software (from scratch or based on another engine), after much research, I figured out I would need to list out all the features I want for my software. In that way, I will decide what my engine will need and what it won’t need. 
 
So, I’ve created an Excel Spreadsheet to list out all the features I would need, how important they are and details them in smaller tasks as much as possible. 

It would be something similar to *“Will the main menu have a LEAVE button ? Will there be a confirmation window displayed when we click it ? What about the “save template” button ? Has it no confirmation window ?”*, as many possibilities could be addressed. 

I will use this spreadsheet as a help for writing my functional specifications. Once I decide everything I need, I’ll have a clearer view on what kind of engine I must build.
